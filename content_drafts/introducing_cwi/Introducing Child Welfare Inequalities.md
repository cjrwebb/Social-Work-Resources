# Introducing Child Welfare Inequalities Part 1: Poverty

This interactive resource is designed to provide a basic introduction to the idea of child welfare inequalities, their scale, and why they are important. You will explore: What are child welfare inequalities and why are they important? What do we currently know about socioeconomic inequalities in intervention? What unanswered questions are there and what are the current policy and practice recommendations from researchers?

## What are child welfare inequalities and why are they important?

Child welfare inequalities refer to the way that children have unequal chances of being involved with child protection and child welfare systems on the basis of their own or their family's identity, demographic characteristics, or socioeconomic status. Professor Paul Bywaters defined child welfare inequalities as:[@bywaters2015exploring]

> "when children and/or their parents face unequal chances, experiences or outcomes of involvement with child welfare services that are systematically associated with structural social dis/advantage and are unjust and avoidable"

The prevalence and trends in child welfare inequalities are important to social work as a profession that is committed to principles of social justice and anti-oppression, for example, as declared in the International Federation of Social Workers' Global Statement of Ethical Principles (ยง3.1):[@ifsw2018global]

> Social workers promote social justice in relation to society generally and to the people with whom they work.

> Social workers challenge discrimination, which includes but is not limited to age, capacity, civil status, class, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, language, nationality (or lack thereof), opinions, other physical characteristics, physical or mental abilities, political beliefs, poverty, race, relationship status, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, spiritual beliefs, or family structure.

Under Article 14 of the Human Rights Act 1998, Section 29 of the Equalities Act 2010, and article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, local authorities have a legal duty to ensure that services provided to children and families do not discriminate on the basis of age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, marital status, race, religion or belief, political opinion, language, or national origin. 

You will notice, interestingly, there is no protection in law against discrimination on the basis of class and/or socioeconomic status; although this is reflected in IFSW's global principles and in the British Association of Social Workers' Code of Ethics, Section 2.2.[@basw2014code] The closest legal requirement to not discriminate on the basis of socioeconomic status is the 'socioeconomic duty', found in Section 1 of the Equality Act 2010:

> An authority to which this section applies must, when making decisions of a strategic nature about how to exercise its functions, have due regard to the desirability of exercising them in a way that is designed to reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socio-economic disadvantage.

However, successive governments have refused to enact the socioeconomic duty as law, meaning families have no recourse to legal protection on the basis of socioeconomic or class-based discrimination.[@poverty2solutionsNDenact] This is important for understanding why social work awareness of socioeconomic inequalities are vital.

## The Scale of Socioeconomic inequalities in Child Welfare

BOX: Term

**Socioeconomic status** refers to a person's combined social and economic position and resources in society, usually measured by a combination of education, occupation, and income.[@baker2014socioeconomic] This is usually based on Bourdieusian  ideas of capital, which he divided into *economic*, *social*, *cultural* and *symbolic*.[@wacquant2006pierre] In practice, the first three are usually used in reference to socioeconomic status. As an oversimplified summary, *Economic* capital refers to fairly self-explanatory income, wealth, and other material resources. *Social* capital refers to valuable connections with other people or institutions that can be used to a person's benefit, for example, if a parent knows a headteacher at a local grammar school and uses this connection to get information and resources to assist with their child's application, they are leveraging their social capital. *Cultural* capital refers to skills and knowledge that is often passed on from parents or communities to children, in relation to how these different skills are valued; it is commonly seen in levels of education. For example, the family around a child may provide greater resources about literature by providing 'classic' books and encouraging reading, which a child would likely be able to use in their life to their own advantage (to create social capital or economic). Importantly, cultural capital's worth depends on what the wider society sees as valuable - a similar family might encourage the same amount of reading but they may not have the pre-existing cultural capital to know what kinds of books are 'valuable' for their child to read. 

END OF BOX

Children from the poorest ten per cent of neighbourhoods are ten times more likely to be in foster or residential care than children from the least poor ten per cent of neighbourhoods.[@bywaters2020child] We call this a social gradient. This is true even after controlling for ethnicity and ethnic density, spatial clustering, income inequality, and infant mortality.[@webb2020untangling] The same or very similar patterns have also been found all over the world in Western/colonial settler nations, including in New Zealand,[@keddell2019child] the United States of America,[@lindsey1991factors; @maguire2017community; @putnam2013racial; @coulton2007neighborhoods] Australia,[@tilbury2015aboriginal] Israel[@sulimani2013child] and Canada.[@esposito2017out] In England and Wales, income deprivation is by far the strongest predictor of variation in local authority child protection plan/register and children looked-after rates.[@webb2020income] We estimated that as much as 75 per cent of the variation in children looked-after rates across England and Wales, and almost 50 per cent of variation in child protection plans/registrations could be explained by the differences in income deprivation and income inequality across the country.

The following graph shows how the average child protection plan and children looked-after rates per 10,000 change in different deciles of neighbourhood deprivation, where 10 is the most deprived 10 per cent of neighbourhoods. 

**ADD GRAPH USING CWIP FINAL REPORT DATA - INTERACTIVE BAR CHART**

Further research by Rick Hood, et al. has shown that different levels of socioeconomic deprivation are associated with different types of cases and, most notably, that the most deprived third of local authorities are likely to have a proportion of neglect cases that is around 1.5 times higher than the proportion of neglect cases in low or middle-deprivation local authorities.[@hood2020identifying] This indicates that the poverty a family is experiencing is often interpreted as neglect by social workers. As Tammy Mayes, parent activist at ATD Fourth World frequently explains to social workers and policymakers: poverty is not neglect.[@atd2020donation]

## Unpacking the relationship between poverty and child abuse and neglect

In Dorothy Roberts' book, *Shattered Bonds*, first published in 2002, she argues that poverty becomes embedded in the child protection system in three ways.[@roberts2009shattered] Firstly, Roberts argues that poverty *is* abuse and neglect. It is reflective of a state and society that abuses both children and their parents directly by creating the conditions where the safety net is not adequate enough to support a basic quality of life. In this case, forcing parents to attend parenting classes, budgeting classes, psychotherapy appointments, psychological assessments, will do basically nothing to support then. Practical support and dramatic policy change is needed.

**Video of Mo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf2x3zMfKWk&feature=youtu.be&t=92**

*Moraene Roberts, activist from ATD Fourth World.*

Secondly, it is important to address the fact that in many cases of child maltreatment within poor families there *are* legitimate instances of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse. It is not in the best interests of poor families to ignore this reality. Rather, we need to better understand how poverty can stimulate incidences of domestic violence, physical abuse, or psychological abuse. 

Chronic low-income in childhood and adulthood has been shown to have cumulative effects on self- and emotional-regulation, coping, and working memory.[@evans2013childhood; @evans2009adultworkingmemory; @kim2013effects; @daniel1983child] Living in poverty also creates external stressors, such as poor and overcrowded housing,[@stephens2017housing; @pevalin2008dynamics] fuel poverty,[@liddell2012measuring] and self-medication using drugs or alcohol,[@jones2016understanding] which can contribute towards mental and physical health problems, abusive or neglectful behaviour and interpersonal conflict resulting in domestic violence.[@sidebotham2002child] 

Social work interventions, including the use of child protection plans and direct work with families, tend to focus on the symptoms created at least in part by poverty, rather than the root cause of these symptoms. While there will always be people that require intensive therapeutic and clinical support, there are also a significant number for whom alleviation of poverty would cause an enormous reduction in these risk factors. This, too, may be more economically efficient.

Lastly, Roberts highlights the over-surveillance of families living in poverty and how this shapes their exposure to the child protection system. Roberts argues that there is a greater rate of discovery of child abuse and neglect in poor families than there is in more affluent families and, furthermore, that similar circumstances may be interpreted differently within a (White) middle-class setting.

This is most notable in contemporary social work practice in the use of predictive analytics and tools that purport to identify abuse or neglect.[@eubanks2018automating; @keddell2019algorithmic] These tools are usually built on public datasets that collect information about things like benefits and social housing uptake, missed council tax payments, hospital and GP appointments or admissions, or free school meal eligibility. More affluent families are able to avoid even being 'in' the system in any meaningful way, whereas poor families and logged in it usually as a result of their need for services and support because of poverty.

The end result is a vicious cycle where parents who need to ask for the support they are entitled to have evidence of this later  used as a risk factor to justify child protection involvement. This doesn't just influence algorithms or predictive analytics. Such records are commonly brought to care proceedings as evidence of poor parenting capacity or irresponsibility. If they strengthen cases, they then become more likely to be used. In response, parents may be less likely to take up the benefits and support services they are entitled too, which might worsen the impact of poverty on their own and their children's lives.


EXERCISE BOX: case studies

## Socioeconomic contexts and rationing

Poverty and inequality don't just have an effect on practice and parenting. They also shape the provision of services and the interpretation of needs and child protection outcomes at a far more macro level. Three factors have been identified as significantly changing rates of intervention and the relationship between poverty and child protection: the inverse intervention law, the income inequality intervention law, and inequitable rationing.  

The inverse intervention law refers to the finding that local authorities with high levels of deprivation tended to have fewer inequalities between poor neighbourhood intervention rates and affluent neighbourhood intervention rates than local authorities with low levels of deprivation.[@bywaters2015exploring] For example, Webb et al. (2020) estimated that high deprivation local authorities had a Children Looked-After social gradient of around 1.5, meaning that there was about a 1.5 times increase in  children looked-after rates when comparing an average high-deprivation neighbourhood to an average deprivation neighbourhood. By contrast, low deprivation local authorities had a social gradient of around 1.9, meaning that an average high deprivation neighbourhood would have nearly twice the rates of children looked-after than an average neighbourhood. In other words, less deprived local authorities intervene with their poorest families more disproportionately than more deprived local authorities.[@webb2020untangling] 

**BOX: What is income inequality?**

**Income inequality** refers to how fairly distributed all of the income earned in a place (a nation or a local authority) is across everyone who lives there. For example, if the total amount of income learned in a local authority with 10,000 people living in it was ยฃ300,000,000 (ยฃ300million), and every single person had an income of ยฃ30,000, we would call this a local authority with a perfectly equal income distribution. Instead, if only one of the 10,000 people earned all ยฃ300million of the income, and everyone else earned ยฃ0, this would be a perfectly unequal income distribution. A number called a Gini Coefficient is usually calculated to express how equal or unequal an income distribution is. It is a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 means that every single person receives an identical share of income and 1 means that one person receives all of the income and everyone else receives nothing. The UK has a Gini coefficient of around 0.35, the USA has a Gini coefficient of around 0.434, Sweden has a Gini coefficient of around 0.28.

**END BOX**

The income inequality intervention law refers to a very similar phenomenon where local authorities with high income inequality have greater socioeconomic inequalities between poor and more affluent families in terms of their child protection interventions. In this case, the social gradient for children looked-after rates in high income inequality local authorities was estimated to be 2.009, meaning that in a high income inequality local authority we'd expect children looked-after rates that were twice as high in high-deprivation neighbourhoods as the rates in average-deprivation neighbourhoods. In low income inequality local authorities, the social gradient was 1.435 for children looked-after rates.[@webb2020untangling] 

In addition to this, recent research found that higher income inequality was associated with higher rates of children look-after in England and Wales, not just higher inequalities in rates.[@webb2020income] Overall, the strength of the income inequality effect was around one-third the size of the deprivation effect, meaning it was quite substantial. However, this was not true for child protection plan/register rates. 

**Graph: plot of differing social gradients side by side** 

Lastly, local authorities with high deprivation have also seen a more significant reduction in their spending on children's services over the last ten years (2010-2019). This was particularly acute immediately following the election of the coalition government in 2010/11, where the most deprivation 50 local authorities saw year-on-year cuts to early help and family support spending that was 1.5 times greater than the year-on-year cuts in the 50 least deprived local authorities.[webb2018austerity]

Annette Hastings has described how this kind of reduction in funding often leads to rationing of the available resources, meaning that people in charge of providing services often exercise greater discretion in distributing them.[@hastings2009poor] This discretion usually means that services tend to be protected, or improved, for more middle-class communities who have a greater amount of social capital to exploit (they are better able to make their voices heard when they complain to local councillors!) Workers also tend to engage in their own rationing practices, withholding what they know is limited support from people they deem to be 'undeserving'. This is particularly worrying when we consider the fact that there are strong negative narratives of people most in need of support, for example, single mothers living in poor areas, in popular media.[@tyler2008chav; @skeggs2004class] 

**Interactive graph of change in spending on EH/FS average**

## How do socioeconomic inequalities get 'into the system'?

There has been little empirical work completed on how these things, the inverse intervention law, the income inequality law and income inequality effect, and the rationing of resources lead to child welfare inequalities in child protection systems and practice. However, we can apply Roberts' model of the ways that poverty results in greater child welfare interventions to create some ideas.

**Making sense of the inverse intervention law**

The inverse intervention law may represent a kind of 'visibility hypothesis', where poor families 'stand out' more to services for intervention.[@garland1998minority] When there is widespread poverty and deprivation, it may be that poor families come under a lot less surveillance than when there is not widespread deprivation. This might be, for example, in schools. If it is normal for children to have unwashed hair or school uniforms, this might be less likely to lead to a referral than in a school where it is uncommon.

Another possible theory is the 'cupboard space' theory, which I attribute to Professor Kate Morris (although I don't believe it is written down anywhere, but may be in Protecting Children: A Social Model.)[@featherstone2018protecting] After controlling for underlying levels of deprivation and special education needs and disability, more deprived local authorities actually have had far fewer resources to spend per child since 2014 than more affluent local authorities. This was reported by Children England in their submission to the comprehensive spending review, a graph from which is reproduced below.[@childrenengland2020comprehensive] Morris' thesis goes: 'social workers are like cupboard space, the more space you have the more you'll fill it up'. In other words, the more resources you have to invest in a risk-averse, protection-focused system, the more children you are likely to bring in, and the lower thresholds you are likely to have for intervention. 

**CE graph showing effective spending**

Moreover, the children brought into the system in more affluent local authorities appear to be more likely to have their cases progressed through to more serious interventions. This is what Hood, et al. found in their recent research, that children in more affluent local authorities were more likely to progress *through* to child protection conferences, plans, and care orders, than children in more deprived local authorities whose cases were more likely to be 'filtered out' to early help at or before the 'Child in Need' stage.[@hood2020identifying] 


**Making sense of the income inequality intervention law**

There has been far less theorising of how the income inequality intervention effect emerges. This is partly because of how difficult it is to understand what local inequality really means, as we tend to think of inequality at much larger national or even global levels. When we talk about local inequality in England, we are usually talking about the scale of division between the very low-income population in the area and the 'professional' middle-income population. In other words, a local area (a city or county) with high *local* income inequality is likely to be a place where a large proportion of the population live on very low paid, insecure work, and/or welfare support, that *also* has a sizeable proportion of people with a 'comfortable' income, largely made up of those who work in essential professional roles including doctors, teachers, and social workers.[@webb2020socioeconomic] This actually tends to mean that more deprived places have higher *local* income inequality. As you may have noticed, this means that the inverse intervention law and the income inequality intervention law sit in opposition, and in equilibrium, with each other.[@webb2020untangling]

High income inequality likely means these two populations have very different lived experiences, low inequality means they are likely to have more similar lived experiences. This is arguably because in low income inequality places, where there is a smaller gulf between the middle-income population and low-income population, there is less segregation between the two. To illustrate this, consider contrasting somewhere like Sunderland, one of the most deprived 20% of local authorities and one of the highest income-unequal local authorities, with Wokingham, one of the least deprived local authorities in the country with low levels of local income inequality.

In Sunderland, a middle-earning salary in a profession with fairly standard national rates of pay is likely to buy you a nicer lifestyle than many people on a low income in the local authority would be able to afford. Probably, you could afford to rent or buy a house in Tunstall or off Pattinson Road, the least deprived parts of Sunderland, where the median house price in 2018 was between ยฃ200,000 and ยฃ250,000. By contrast, the median house prices in the *poorest* parts of Wokingham in 2018 were between ยฃ400,000 and ยฃ550,000; likely out of the reach of many middle-earning professionals. 

This means that, in Sunderland, middle- and higher-earning professionals - social workers, doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers, solicitors, and judges, all of whom play a part in children's services and have to have a presence all over the country - are far more likely to live away from the families living in poverty that they predominantly work with. By contrast, middle-earning professionals in Wokingham are far more likely to live side-by-side with the families they work with because their middle-income will purchase them a much lower quality of life than it would in a place like Sunderland. They are more likely to be living in social or rented housing. They are also more likely to be on a low-income after housing costs and council tax due to differences in the cost of living. Moreover, their *gross* income is likely to be more similar to similarly sized families receiving housing benefits, as these benefits need to be much higher than elsewhere in the country to account for different housing markets. Lastly, the very poorest people that they are most different to the professional class will be priced out of Wokingham altogether, and under the jurisdiction of another local authority. 

This creates a situation where, maybe paradoxically in the context of the relationship between deprivation and local income inequality, the social workers and other children's services professionals living in local authorities with low local income inequality have more similar lived experiences with families than the professionals living in high income inequality local authorities. In a speculative blog, I call this an 'organic empathy' effect.[@webb2020socioeconomic] In more income equal local authorities, social workers may be able to develop greater empathy for the socioeconomic conditions that their families living in poverty face in the course of their own lives. In less income equal local authorities, there may be limited opportunities to develop this socioeconomic empathy organically, which might feed into decision-making processes. 

Using Roberts' distinctions of how poverty-related interventions emerge, we might see how this lack of shared experiences might lead to a greater likelihood of poverty being interpreted as neglect or abuse and treated as a parental, rather than communal, failing. That is not to say that this is inevitable, if true. Empathy might still be developed 'inorganically' or 'synthetically' to reverse the income inequality intervention law through better, prolonged, and more meaningful engagement and participation with parents. For now, we don't have enough research on this unusual pattern in child welfare intervention to be sure about any theory; but it does bear thinking about.
 
 
 **Making sense of rationing**
  
Most social workers are probably keenly aware of the effect that austerity and rationing has had on their ability to provide services for families. Most notably, it was early help and family support services that saw the greatest cuts to their spending since 2010.[@webb2018austerity] Social workers may be aware of the effect this might have had on their practice, for example, in new management restrictions on discretionary payments under Section 17 of the Children Act. But rationing is not just boring accounting; it is an ideology that people will subscribe to to varying degrees. 

Reductions can quickly become rationalised in sentiments about some families not 'deserving' early help and family support services, if social workers and other professionals take on the 'language of austerity' and begin to employ their own rationing measures.[@hastings2009poor; @stanley2014we; @devaney2019trouble] At the practice level, social workers may consciously or unconsciously deploy austerity and rationing narratives to justify withholding services from people they believe 'do not deserve' them. Needless to say, this kind of rationalisation is unjust, and is often something that fails to be addressed in supervision.

Early help and family support services are often utilised to help families manage or remove external stressors that can affect parenting or put children at risk. For example, these services might assist with drug addiction, mental wellbeing, postnatal support, or parenting education. However, often overlooked are services that might help with a large confluence of issues, or that offer more practical support and ordinary help, which might be financial but also could be related to providing childcare to help parents work or get some respite. Needless to say, these latter services principally address the 'causes of the causes' highlighted by Roberts. These services have also been steadily eroded away over the last three decades and replaced with the former kind of symptom-specific, psychological or medical interventions.[@white2014re;  @wastell2017blinded; @hood2020identifying]

If Roberts is correct - which all existing research says she is[@cooper2013does; @cooper2017does] - that stress caused by exposure to poverty contributes significantly to events that lead to child protection and removal, it does not take much foresight to see how disastrous the direction of austerity and rationing has taken is. We are, as a society, dealing less and less frequently with the socioeconomic conditions underlying a vast proportion of social problems and more and more frequently addressing the intermediary symptoms. This, clearly, does nothing to offset growing needs in communities. While the intermediary services may be effective and may help, they are hugely expensive and scale poorly. Meanwhile, the kinds of services sacrificed under austerity scale well and, although they may be less effective on an individual level, can create large and unpredictable positive benefits at a population level.[@stewart2011should]

**Summary**
This very brief sense-making section shows some possible routes by which complex structural factors can get 'into the system' in ways that are consistent with the ways we understand poverty to be related to child welfare interventions: either directly, as an abusive condition that can 'stand-out' more in some places than in others; intermediately, as a stressor that can lead to parental acts of abuse or neglect that services are increasingly failing to alleviate; and indirectly, as a mechanism to create surveillance in a highly risk-averse system. 


## Not the whole picture

Before concluding, it's important to state that poverty is neither an absolute explanation of all neglect and abuse,[@font2020s] nor is it the only structural inequality in the child protection system. Age, ethnicity, gender, disability, and national identity inequalities, to name just a few, are also significant and important to understand. Furthermore, our existing research has found that these inequalities are intersectional,[@webb2020cuts] and a specific resources has been created that focuses on the intersection between ethnic inequality and socioeconomic inequality [here](http://scslibrary.calumwebb.uk/posts/intersection-ethnicity-deprivation/). 

Socioeconomic inequalities, those related to poverty, are, however, the largest inequalities we are aware of in children's social services and therefore are crucial for social workers to grasp. As we saw in our brief review of equalities legislation at the start of this resource, this is especially important as there are no provisions in place for statutory protection of people from discrimination on the basis of their socioeconomic status. 



## Practice recommendations

The British Association of Social Workers' and the Child Welfare Inequalities Project released the ['Anti-Poverty Practice Guide for Social Work'](https://www.basw.co.uk/what-we-do/policy-and-research/anti-poverty-practice-guide-social-work) in 2019, which included the following practice and policy messages:[@basw2019anti]


**BOX**

#### Policies and Systems Messages

**1. Using and understanding data**

The use of data about poverty and indicators of deprivation has an uneven history in social work. In some areas, often those more connected to health and therefore the study of health inequalities, we have seen growing awareness of unequal outcomes driven by socio-economic circumstances. In other areas, such as safeguarding children and/or adults, there is no data collected on the socioeconomic circumstances of the families involved, making it difficult to examine the relationship between deprivation and need for statutory services within localities. The development of robust data about patterns and relationships between poverty and social work involvement will ensure that routine awareness of the links is developed and can support the development of policies and practices (nationally and locally). Building social workersโ confidence in interpreting and using data helps ensure that poverty is not overlooked in the provision of services and the development of practice. (see the [Data(,) Power, and Social Work resource](http://scslibrary.calumwebb.uk/posts/data-power-social-work/))

The demographic profile of an area can become taken-for-granted knowledge for social workers, based on everyday practice. But there is enormous value in ensuring this knowledge matches reality โ not least in order to ensure services and skills are relevant. Supporting the development of a working knowledge of the areas served, including deprivation, ethnicity, population density is critical for all practitioners, rather than restricted to strategic or planning staff. Therefore social workers should be assisted to understand the levels of poverty in their locality and they should also ensure that they reflect on this and include this in their decision-making about the people they work with.

**2. Knowing local communities**

The research by CWIP revealed that social workers and their managers struggled to access and use data and knowledge about their localities. This was partly caused by their location in remote parts of the communities โ this meant that they had to drive rather than walk to home visits, missing the opportunities to interact and understand their areas.

Some social workers in the CWIP study had developed a stigmatising narrative about streets and places, at odds with social work core values. In their narratives, they did not show understanding of the strengths within their localities of work. However, organisations and teams that prize knowledge of local income maximisation services, anti-poverty  organisations, relief services and community informal support, increase their capacity to recognise and respond effectively to local needs. Therefore, social workers should understand the local and organisational contexts that they work in, the third sector providers, the religious organisations and others that people draw on for support. This knowledge is most valuable when itโs based on direct relationships with the people involved rather than knowledge of a list of resources.

**3. Building and maintaining interagency**

The extent to which alliances have been formed with anti-poverty organisations varies considerably across teams and localities. There are examples of co-location of income maximisation staff in duty teams and social workers working closely with local food banks, but there is also evidence of lack of partnerships with housing, employment and poverty relief agencies. Attention is often given to partnerships with health, education and therapeutic services despite poverty often being the common experience of those needing services. Imaginative alliances connecting anti-poverty services with social work offer opportunities to ensure that the core priorities of people experiencing deprivation (for example, for food, warmth, housing and safety) remains the central objectives of social workers. Social workers should draw on their professional leadership skills and build alliances with individuals and organisations that can assist people experiencing poverty.

**4. Involving communities and families**

For social work to understand the impact of socioeconomic conditions on communities and families, and the extent to which social work services reinforce or help address these determinants, opportunities for meaningful conversations and feedback are essential. For many individuals and families the only means of providing feedback is largely negative and based on the complaints systems. Developing routine practices that enable feedback from families and communities about the role of social work services in addressing poverty, that are not based on individual complaints, opens up opportunities to create fresh approaches to community participation. These can include involvement in designing, commissioning, and evaluating services. Social workers should therefore seek formal or informal feedback from people they work with and their colleagues, and through critical reflection, explore how they can improve their work with people experiencing poverty.

#### Practice models and skills

**1. Community social work practice**

Social workers should recognise themselves as part of the communities in which they work because they share the space with people who use services. This โco locationโ provides social workers with the opportunities to know the area and understand resources available. Community social work is a generic term for multiple approaches, reflecting the fact that communities may be based on locality, faith, ethnicity or identity. It is, however, evident that established individual casework models can only achieve specific impact when peopleโs needs are driven by wider systematic patterns of poverty and socioeconomic hardships. Thinking more broadly about the community or communities that surround the individual needing services allows social work to acknowledge social and economic determinants of needs and harms. Opportunities to develop skills in community social work that are valued and respected by employing agencies increases the possibilities for fresh approaches that address socioeconomic conditions to be  built and sustained. To be effective, social workers should assist people to (re)connect to family members and community groups  who can provide additional support to them.

**2. Relationship-based approaches**

Relationship-based social work seeks to understand and address the psychological and emotional impact of past traumatic events on people. Starting from the position that the relationship between the professional and service user can be a conduit for change, the model(s) emphasise empathy, respect of peopleโs dignity, allowing them to tell their stories, and recognising their inner strengths. Practicing within a relationship-based framework enables social workers to understand peopleโs life histories and to hear their lived experiences, bringing together the wider societal analysis of the determinants of harm with individual support plans.

**3. Advocacy based practice**

Social work interventions with people living in poverty should start from the position that they have socio-economic rights.

This implies focussing on:

* Empowering people to obtain their legally entitled bene๏ฌts and support
* Assisting people to challenge any denials of their socio-economic, political, and human rights
* Evidencing how poverty is contributing to the violations of peopleโs human rights โfor example, people being unable to access or sustain a healthcare plan because of lack of money; how poverty is compounding their physical or mental impairments

Income maximisation should be one of the core aims of the advocacy strand of anti-poverty approaches. This will involve social workers assisting families to access money and services that they are legally entitled to โ for example welfare benefits, unpaid wages, and other payments in kind. Thus, one element is about increasing peopleโs income, but a second is ensuring that families do not wrongly pay for services that they are entitled to โ for instance domiciliary care or family support services.

The implication of this discussion is that social workers should include conversations about income, money and poverty in their work with families, including assessments and care planning. However, the findings of the CWIP research indicate that social workers find it difficult to discuss poverty and finances, perceiving them as intrusive and potentially stigmatising. Yet, for individuals and families, not acknowledging their everyday reality is frustrating and can result in plans that are simply not feasible. Supporting social workers to become con๏ฌdent in talking about poverty, income and their consequences is a key organisational learning need. Social workers should develop their understanding of welfare benefits and the organisations that provide specialist support.

**4. The role of supervision**

Research has shown that the organisational and national policy context of social work can adversely impact on how social workers respond to people experiencing poverty. The social workers involved in the development of this Anti-poverty Practice Guide noted that high caseloads, tight timescales and lack of services affected their responses to people experiencing poverty. Given their narrow repertoires of choices, they prioritised safeguarding over provision of holistic support to families experiencing poverty. The CWIP study found that practitioners were experiencing a โmoral muddleโ; to identify poverty as a critical issue was felt to be stigmatising, yet to deny its impact was profoundly unhelpful to families.

Managing this complex ethical and emotional territory requires supervisors to be con๏ฌdent in: understanding the relationship between poverty and harm, the impact of poverty on everyday experiences, and the role of social workers in addressing the consequences of socioeconomic hardship.

Developing the knowledge and skills needed to support and supervise staff working with enduring socioeconomic hardship requires specific training, an understanding of the emotional and ethical demands and  clarity about the methods by which social work can avoid reinforcing the consequences of living in poverty.

More recently, there have been discussions around the commonalities between the Social Model of Child Protection[@featherstone2018protecting] and Contextual Safeguarding.[@firmin2020contextual; @firmin2017contextual] You can find out more about the two models and how they relate to one another in the context of practice by [reading this report](https://www.csnetwork.org.uk/assets/documents/CS-and-SM-Messages-for-practice-FINAL.pdf).[@featherstone2020social]


## Review

* Freedom from discrimination on the basis of class or socioeconomic status exists in social work's global principles and codes of ethics, but this kind of protection from discrimination is not currently enforceable in English law. Socioeconomic inequalities in interventions are therefore an important matter for social workers. 
* Socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions are substantial, with income deprivation and income inequality explaining the majority of variations in intervention and children in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods being 10 times more likely to be living in care. 
* Poverty can increase child welfare interventions in three ways: directly, as a form of societal abuse; intermediately, as a stressor that can lead to or exacerbate parental neglect or abuse; or indirectly, through systems that over-surveil families living in poverty.
* Contextual factors are associated with large differences in socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions: income inequality and overall low deprivation are associated with greater socioeconomic inequalities, and cuts to services have also been made more heavily in deprived areas.
* How these contextual factors get 'into the system' is not well understood, but poor families may 'stand out' more in some contexts; income inequality may create empathy gaps between social workers and families that make relational and community-based practice difficult; and under austerity and insufficient service funding, workers may employ rationing narratives and service leaders may defund services related to poverty alleviation, with the end result being an increase in the associated intermediate stressors between poverty and child abuse, like drug and alcohol abuse or domestic violence.  
* Making the child protection system work for families living in poverty requires a commitment to rethinking multiple structural, systemic, practice, and relational dimensions of social work, but there are steps that every individual social worker, team manager, and director of children's services can take.

## Case study

Ciaran lives in Lawcourt, Annesbury, one of the most deprived wards in Monarshire, an otherwise affluent county. He is 11 years old and started seven months ago as a student at a community college in a more affluent part of Monarshire. He was previously a student much closer to home at a primary school in Lawcourt, and had never been referred to children's social services before. His school had referred him to children's services after his form tutor noticed that he frequently came to school in visibly dirty uniform with unbrushed hair, notable because it also appeared to be cut very infrequently. His tutor also noticed that he had started to develop a persistent cough. His family were originally referred to an early help service, but after a work coach at a local Job Centre reported that he had bruises on his arm the case was escalated to an assessment. Ciaran and his stepfather were at the Job Centre as his stepfather was unable to find any childcare for Ciaran at the time of his Job Centre appointment. Following the assessment, the social work team had decided to move to a child protection conference to put a plan in place for Ciaran. 

In Ciaran's case files are reflections from the assessing social worker about his home conditions. The file notes that the home, a two bedroom apartment, was untidy and Ciaran was sharing a bedroom with his two stepsisters, aged 4 and 7. His mother and stepfather slept in a second bedroom. His mother claimed to not see the dirty uniform and unbrushed/uncut hair as a problem, as she washed the uniform once a week and couldn't afford to run the washing machine every time it got dirty, and that it did not bother Ciaran anyway. Upon closer inspection, the social worker found the children's shared bedroom to have a growing infestation of black mould. They also reported a lack of food in the fridge. On writing up the initial assessment, the social worker used the council's 'integrated insight system' to find that Ciaran's mother had previously been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and his stepfather had been arrested and sentenced in his early 20s for aggravated assault. These were noted as important risk factors.

At the child protection conference, Ciaran's mother brought an advocate, a community support worker who had known both Ciaran's mother and his stepfather for more than 5 years. The advocate, Mrs. Masey, explained to those in attendance at the conference that Ciaran's mother had reported the mould to her private landlord when it started to develop six months ago, but no action had been taken by the landlord or the council. It turned out that the mould had been a previous problem but had been painted over after the last tenants left. She explained that the community charity she works for used to receive a grant from the council for small housing renovations, but that this had been stopped five years ago. The family was unable to move to a new property because of the cost involved. Ciaran's mother also explained that she was sectioned three years before Ciaran, her oldest child, was born, and that her husband, Ciaran's stepfather, was convicted before they became a couple. She was unable to explain the bruises on Ciaran's arm and said that they were 'probably from fighting with his sister'.  

A plan was created and taken to the council's resource panel for approval. At this panel, it was proposed that Mrs. Masey's organisation be granted some funds to deal with the immediate health problem that the mould represented. The resource panel refused this request, stating that the more important issue was the child's mother and stepfather's inaction addressing the mould, and that to provide a grant in this circumstance would make them liable for every housing renovation that was raised, which would raise large financial liabilities for the authority and should be the responsibility of the housing team. The team manager argued that the most important factor here was the child's unexplained bruises and the poor parenting that led to inaction on room's mould, especially when the children's parents were from 'high-risk populations'. The plan was changed so that Ciaran's mother and stepfather would instead be expected to attend a series of parenting and budgeting workshops, and were referred to the Citizen's Advice Bureau for support related to the housing conditions and the costs to fix it or move from money they could save from budgeting. 

#### Reflective questions

* Identify at least one instance where poverty could be considered to be 'abusing' the parents and child involved in the case study. What kind of support would prevent this?
* Identify at least one instance where poverty could be acting as a stressor on parenting capacity. What kind of support would prevent this?
* Identify at least one instance where poverty could be resulting in Ciaran's family coming under greater surveillance. What are the consequences of this surveillance?
* How might income inequality and the inverse intervention law affected this case? 
* How has rationing affected this case?
* Identify one recommendation from the Anti-Poverty Practice Guide for Social Work and reflect on how you think it would change the current case (whether you think it would be effective or not).
* How could the local authority have provided better support for the social work team in dealing with this kind of case?
* How could central government have provided better support for the local authority in dealing with this kind of case?

#### Example answers to reflective questions

* Poverty is impacting on the parents' ability to ensure that Ciaran has housing that does not damage his health. This might have been avoided if the council had more available social housing, or more powers to intervene safely with landlords who are failing to maintain their properties. 
* We do not know the source of Ciaran's bruises. It may be that the overcrowded housing associated with poverty is resulting in physical conflicts between him and his siblings, or worse, between him and his parents. Ciaran's parents might also have been able to get support from a legal professional more easily if they had a higher income, which might have helped them deal with the mould problem before it became harmful.
* Ciaran's bruises may not have been noticed or interpreted in the same way if his stepfather was not at a Job Centre. This is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but it could be unfair/unjust if very similar circumstances are not noticed because the families are not living in poverty. 
* Ciaran's clothes and hair might have 'stood out' more in the more affluent area that his college is in. However, his teachers may have been more used to this if they were living in similar places to where Ciaran's family live.  
* The pressure on the council to save money is clearly reflected in the conversations had by the resource panel. The social work team feels unable to act on housing because it would add to their spending.
* If there was more community social work practice in place, there may have been more opportunities available to build coalitions in the community to address housing deprivation and provide early support. This might have removed one or two of the serious risk factors that could have been deciding factors in the case moving to a child protection conference.
* The local authority could have created better 'joined-up' thinking in the provisions that families may need, to avoid the 'rationing competition' between departments.
* Central government could put in place better legislation to support renters in solving problems with their accommodation; or could invest more in social housing development to ensure that there is adequately sized, affordable housing for families.
